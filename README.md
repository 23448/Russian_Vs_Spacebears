# Russians Vs Spacebears

This is a topdown shooter game and your purpose is to escape from the bears and go of the moon back to earth.
this game is based on a true fact that the russians went to space with dual barreled shotguns
because they were afraid of what was up there cause they thought there were bears on the moon.
